So, you're here... Let's get started then!

## Guidelines

- Code should follow formatting guidelines for the language in question.
- New languages should be tested to work.
- The goal is an OOP approach, but this isn't possible in all languages.
- There should be methods `never`, `gonna`, `give`, `you`, and `up`.
- The methods should print `"Never gonna let you down!"` on one line when chained.
- The methods should return self (or its equivalent) for chained method calls.
- For languages with a main function entry point, that function should create a new `Rick`
and call `rick.never().gonna().give().you().up()`.

## Setting up

- Each new language should go in its own folder inside the `src` folder.
- Each new language should have its language specific `.gitignore` added to that folder.

If you are making changes to a language that already exists in the repo, please
be specific about the reason for the changes.

## IMPORTANT!

Have fun with it, smile, I'm glad you're here! :)
